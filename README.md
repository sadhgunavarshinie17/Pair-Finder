In a scenario where a list of unique ID badges numbers 'nums' and a security checkpoint number 'target' is given, the task is to find a pair of ID badges whose numbers sum up to the security checkpoint number.
The indices of these ID badges should be returned, assuming no ID badge is scanned twice and there exists exactly one unique pair that meets the criteria.
The order of indices in the result does not matter.

Example 1:
<br>
- Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
<br>
- Output: [0, 1]
<br>
Example 2:
<br>
- Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
<br>
- Output: [1, 2]
